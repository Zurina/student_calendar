# Student calendar 

We have made a prolog program based on the student calendar idea with following classes:
    
* Students
* Classes
* Rooms
* Dates

Relationships between the classes have also been established: 

* Students are in classes 
* Classes are in rooms
* Classes have schooldays on certian dates

Following methods have been made to investigate the classes and relationships:

* **is_student_in_class** -> method to check whether a specific student is in a specific student_in_class

* **is_class_in_room** -> method to check whether a specific student_in_class is in a specific room

* **is_schoolday_for_class** -> method to check whether a specific student_in_class has schoolday on a specific date

* **is_students_in_same_class** -> method to check whether two students is in the same class
